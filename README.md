# Crochet Exercises

A bunch of programming exercises, but done in Crochet.

All of these packages rely on the latest experimental Crochet release,
you can run `npm install` at the root of this repository to get it, then
run `./node_modules/.bin/crochet repl <path/to/directory/crochet.json>`
to start a REPL for a package.

The Advent of Code packages follow the `dayN partN` convention for exposing
the solutions, so running part 1 of day 1 for AoC 2021 would look as follows:

    $ ./node_modules/.bin/crochet repl aoc2021/crochet.json
    Crochet v0.12.0 | interactive shell
    (Press Ctrl+D to exit. Multi-line can be done with partial parses)

    >>> day1 part1
